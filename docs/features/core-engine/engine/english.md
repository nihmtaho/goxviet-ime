# English Detection Module

**Note**: The English detection logic has been migrated to `engine_v2` for improved performance and accuracy.

This module (`core/src/engine/english`) currently serves as a re-export facade for `crate::engine_v2::english::phonotactic::PhonotacticEngine`.

For detailed documentation on the English detection capabilities, please refer to [Engine V2 English Documentation](../engine_v2/english.md).
